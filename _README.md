# JAVA21-christian-tallner-html-slutprojekt
This is the final project of the html and css class in JAVA21 at gritacademy.  
The project aims to create a portfolio of my work and competence.



QUESTIONS:
- How to align items inside a child? (eg a the text in the header)
- My hover effects on the email symbol sucks
- When using one CSS and many html, always use classes to separate items?
